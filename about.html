    <h1>ayse sultan guneroglu</h1>
    <p class="content-text">
      Ayse Sultan Guneroglu is an architect with a special interest in Urban
      Design. In 2014 Ayse Sultan graduated from Istanbul Bilgi University with
      a Bachelor's degree in Architecture. Globally she has held residence in
      seven different cities for the entirety of her life. Walking the streets
      is her passion. Her approach to design begins with an emphasis on context
      and the value of what is present, afterwhich she develops concepts as
      strategies for design iterations. No project is ever complete. 
    </br>
</br>
      She greedily devours every opportunity to learn and understand how things work
      and engages in many hobbies as a result. Pre-pandemic she loved to bake,
      but has an unfortunate aversion to anything popular, viral or mainstream.
      She is fascinated by the structure of crochet, the topography generated in
      fabric through patterns and sewing, the roots and lives of words and any
      and all textures. She had a thing for photography and psychology in college but
      regretfully found them too popular for her taste to pursue seriously. She
      is a rebel at heart.
</br>
</br>
      These days she is busy building web pages using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
      Bootstrap, API, Flexbox with Netlify hosting. Check out some of her projects 
      here: <a href="https://cozy-centaur-aef18d.netlify.app" class="btn">üéÄlet's go‚ú®</a>
      Oh, she can also speak English, Turkce and understand Arabic.
